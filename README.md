# Generative-AI-Virtual-Meeting-Background
The Work From Home (WFH) environment has made it increasingly more difficult to "get noticed" in meetings, taking away the up-front, lively nature of the in-person work setting. New data has revealed that across all industries in a seven year period, WFH employees are 38% less likely on average to have received a bonus than those who have never worked virtually. This script changes that, providing users with AI-powered virtual meeting backgrounds that are custom-generated in accordance to one’s overall palette– tones in somebody’s skin, jewelry, and clothing. Color psychology is real, and there’s a reason people shell out the big bucks to figure out their palette and learn what clothes, colors, and tones can help optimize their appearance. In the WFH setting, having an engaging and color-optimized background can increase an employee’s chance of getting noticed, thereby enhancing connection and credibility in the virtual workplace. It’s time to turn those cameras on!

In the early stages of this tool’s development, users must first use their own custom-generated API key from OpenAI. There are several internet tutorials on how to locate this! Once that’s inputted, feel free to change the prompts for the analogous, complementary and “og” color schemes at the bottom of the script. All three of these color schemes are tailored to your palette and will help you look your (computational) best!
